# Configuration

The configuration file is a YAML file restricted to the specific keys
(validated by [YaMaLe](https://github.com/23andMe/Yamale)), which can be specified in _overlay style_
(values in the __default__ section is used for specific fields when missing in other sections)
allowing to omit repeating default values.

The following sections can be specified:

## General configuration

- `title`: The title of the browser tab/window
- `database_name`: The path and name of the SQLite database (relative to `read_config.py`)
- `excluded_tables` (set): Tables to be excluded from the secondary field values
   (suggested value: main table if there are multiple tables)
- `excluded_columns` (set): Columns to be excluded from the primary field values at init time
   (suggested value: displayed_column_name value and any column with very large distinct value set)
- `displayed_column_table_name`: The name of the table contains the column to be displayed
   (usually sentences or clauses)
- `displayed_column_name`:  The name of the column to be displayed (usually sentences or clauses)
- `ui-strings`: The following fixed set of options for text shown on the search interface
   (can be used for localisation):
  - `locale`: The name of the locale to use for sorting
  - `submit`: The caption of the submit button
  - `reset`: The caption of the reset button (which resets form to the latest used setting)
  - `clear_field_values`: The caption of the clear button (which clears values and checkboxes for all fields)
  - `footer`: The HTML fragment to use for the footer (e.g. documentation, citation, etc.).
     In the `: ` (colon-space) substrings, space must be escaped with a `\` (slash) to avoid YAML parse error!
  - `n_more_elems`: The text fragment used to display in the select box if _N more elems available_
     (`{0}` is used to denote the actual N)
  - `save_as_json` and `save_as_tsv`: The text of the link to save the result in the respective format
  - The following error messages can be set (localised):
    - `regex_disabled`: Regex is disabled for field as it contains non-string values
       (`{0}` friendly name + API name pair) 
    - `sort_key_invalid`: Sort key is not specified or the specified field has invalid value
    - `featname_in_multiple_fields`: Featname value appears in multiple fields
       (`{0}` value, `{1}` friendly name + API name pairs) 
    - `same_feature_with_pos_and_neg_signs`: Value appears with and without NOT
       (`{0}` value, `{1}` friendly name + API name pairs)
    - `too_mutch_features_specified`: The maximum allowed features is 60, too mutch features used
       (e.g. by multiple regex match together)
    - `invalid_format`: Invalid output format is specified (`{0}` value, `{1}` possible formats)
    - `featname_value_too_broad_regex`: The maximum allowed features is 60, too mutch features used
       (e.g. by a single regex match)
       (`{0}` value, `{1}` friendly name + API name pair)
    - `invalid_value`: Specified value is not present in the database column
       (`{0}` value, `{1}` friendly name + API name pair)
    - `featname_invalid_value`: Specified feature value is not present in the database as table name
       (`{0}` value, `{1}` friendly name + API name pair)
    - `invalid_regex`: The regex in field value is misformatted and cannot be compiled
       (`{0}` value, `{1}` friendly name + API name pair)
    - `featname_invalid_regex`: The regex in feature name is misformatted and cannot be compiled
       (`{0}` value, `{1}` friendly name + API name pair)
    - `non_empty_value_for_empty_featname`: Cannot specify value for empty feature name
       (`{0}` value, `{1}` friendly name + API name pair)
    - `featname_regex_invalid_value`: The regex in feature name do not matches any feature names
       (`{0}` value, `{1}` friendly name + API name pair)

## Form configuration

The `default` key contains the default values for each form element, which can be overloaded
in the specific field definitions. Each form element defined in `fields` as list element and is displayed
in the order of definition.
There are two types of fields: the _simple fields_ type has fixed table and column names,
and displays the possible values as a scrollable _datalist_, while the _complex fields_ type has only the column fixed,
and the user can specify the table to be used for the query in the secondary input field (_feature name_).
Each field has one (simple) or two (complex) input fields and each input field has `not` and `regex` checkboxes
which makes the query treat the corresponding input value as a negated value, a regular expression, or both.

The keys for each field element can be the following:

- `friendly_name`: The name to be used for referring to the field in the UI
   (field names in the HTML form and error messages)
- `table_name`: The database table name to be used for the field (if `null`, field is treated as _complex field_)
- `col_name`: The database column name to be used for the field
- `fn_value`: The default value for the _feature name_ if the field is complex
- `featelems_aliases`: The dictionary for additional aliases for _feature name_ values (SQL table names)
   to be used in the form `alias: TABLE_NAME`
- `fn_not`: Boolean value to treat the secondary input value as negated or not by default
- `fn_regex`: Boolean value to treat the secondary input value as regex or not by default
- `api_name`: The name of the field in the API. The secondary field (feature name) is named `f{api_name}FEATNAME`,
   `not` and `regex` checkboxes are suffixed with `NOT` and `REGEX` automatically
   (e.g. `f{api_name}NOT`, `f{api_name}REGEX` and `f{api_name}FEATNAME_NOT`, `f{api_name}FEATNAME_REGEX`)
- `value`: The default value for the primary input field
- `not`: Boolean value to treat the primary input value as negated or not by default
- `regex`: Boolean value to treat the primary input value as regex or not by default
- `sort_key`: Boolean value to treat the field as default sort key
   (exactly one key must be specified by setting this value true!)
- `limit`: The upper limit for the number of displayed options in the dropdown list when typing
   (0 or greater, the displayed elems are in alphabetical order)
- `radio_tooltip`: Tooltip for the radio button
- `field_name_tooltip`: Tooltip for the field name text
- `not_tooltip`: Tooltip for the NOT text (for the first checkbox if there are two)
- `regex_tooltip`: Tooltip for the Regex text (for the first checkbox if there are two)
- `featname_not_tooltip`: Tooltip for the NOT text (for the second checkbox if there are two)
- `featname_regex_tooltip`: Tooltip for the Regex text (for the second checkbox if there are two)

## Other query parameters

These extra parameters can be used to modify the displayed results in the query:

- `format` (values can be `HTML`, `TSV`, `JSON`): The output formats to display the results can be HTML, TSV and JSON
   according to the setting (the default is 'HTML' for Web UI and 'TSV' for the CLI)
- `limit` (default: 1000): The number of entries to be displayed on one page
   (rounded up to completely display all entries for the last key)
- `page` (default: 0): The number of the page to be displayed in the paginated output

# Your really own database in Aszal√≥ DB schema

1. Create a database in TSV format with a header for field names.
    If your data is sparse (e.g. verbal frames for grammatical cases) use NULL string for empty elements
    (and consider using separate tables in the database).
2. Create a configuration for [`tsv2sql.py`](../scripts/tsv2sql.py)
    (see [example configuration for Mazsola](../scripts/mazsola_filtered_5.yaml))
3. Run [`tsv2sql.py -i your_database.TSV -o your_database.sqlite3 -c your_configuration.yaml`](../scripts/tsv2sql.py)
4. Profit! :)

## Configuration

The configuration is similar to the one used in the [form configuration](#form-configuration) section.
There is a default column which serves as an overlay for the omitted properties for the columns.
For each column, the following properties are required under the column key in a list:

- `column_name`: The name of the column in the input TSV
- `table_name`: Main table name (ignored for the actual column if it resides in separate table, e.g. separate is true)
- `sql_column_name`: Unified column name for separate tables or unique name for main table (ID as value is not allowed!)
- `column_type`: Type for SQL in Python format (`{'str', 'int', 'float', 'none'}`
   `none` means that the column is omitted from the database)
- `index`: Create index for column in the SQL or not (generally recommended to being set true,
   see [general considerations](#some-general-considerations))
- `separate`: Column belongs to the main table or to a separate table? (set/overwrite table_name if true)

The list of columns can be in arbitrary order, but must correspond to the TSV file column definitions.

## Some general considerations

- In the case of sparse data, it is advised to separate columns into different SQL tables (`separate: true`)
- It is advised to create index for columns which contain non-uniq elements and will be exposed to the frontend
   as it will make the queries faster, but makes the sqlite3 file larger
   (i.e. recommended for everything, but example sentences)
- Columns in the TSV can be omitted from the database if not used in the frontend (e.g. `column_type: none`)
- It is advised to use the proper type for the column, but be aware that using non-`str` type disables the regex option
- Try with small queries and generalize slowly, as queries can slow down fast
   if large amount of data needs to be considered

A [conversion script](../scripts/mazsola2tsv.py) with [example configuration](../scripts/mazsola_filtered_5.yaml)
is provided for [Mazsola (Verb Argument Browser)](http://corpus.nytud.hu/mazsola/index_eng.html) as an example
